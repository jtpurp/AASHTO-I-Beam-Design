# AASHTO-I-Beam-Design
Calculates loading limitations of structural steel I-beams based on inputted design parameters (indicated by the grey cells) while adhering to AASHTO LRFD standards.

Assesses moment & shear, composite girder moment, moment redistribution, tension-flange yielding, and web bend buckling loading limitations.
